## Stack (bottom → top)

## Conflict policy
{{conflict_policy}}

Report → `{{report_path}}` § Stack with the table PR → old head → new head → CI → gate → Copilot and the `turnstile pass` lines.

## Don'ts
No Slack, no Jira, no PR comments, no reviewer requests, no "ready", no merges, no rebase or force-push, no subagents,
no `Co-Authored-By`, no generated-with footer, never `turnstile approve`. Wait for CI, a deploy or a gate with ONE blocking command (`gh run watch <id> --exit-status`, `gh pr checks <n> --watch`, the deploy workflow's `wait_for_ready`), never a sleep/poll loop (pass the Bash tool's `timeout` parameter, up to 600000 ms, on that call; if the watch is still running when the timeout expires, call it again instead of polling with short status checks), and never end the turn with an interim "waiting" message — report only when there is a fact. Report at
`{{report_path}}` per `references/reports.md` (Write tool); keep it updated as you go.
